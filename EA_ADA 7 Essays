### 1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?

When I was in 6th grade, my teacher asked us to write what we wanted to do when we grew up. The first thought that came to mind was computer science, but I didn't really know what that was other than it had something to do with computers, which intrigued me. My family did not own a computer, but that was all my teachers talked about.  In 8th grade, I took my first class where I learned about the history of computer development and the fundamentals of typing.  In 10th grade, I was able to put those typing skills to practice when I changed schools and was required to use a computer to complete all of my writing assgnments.  It wasn't until I was in college that I took my first programming class, FORTRAN.  That was the required language for my major.  In spite of learning a primative langauge, I learned the importance of paying attention to detail and thinking through a problem to reaching a viable solution, two skills that still serve me well even though my career pathway took a different direction.  Fortunately, my job as a teacher has afforded me the opportunity to reconnect with programming.  5 years ago, I started teaching basic programming skills to high-schoolers.  It is a 9-week robotics unit where I teach students to program VEX robots using the software, ROBOTC.  During this time, I have come to enjoy programming and its challenges.  I realize web development is different from robotics, so I have also been exposed to Python through Code Academy online tutorials and Ruby on Rails through Ada Applcant Workshop this summer.

About 4 weeks ago, I attended a professional development conference hosted by my school district.  The main focus was to encourage teachers to incorporate new educational technology into our everyday class settings in an effort to personalize learning for each student.  The conference kicked-off with a keynote address given by the Distinguished Technology Evangelist of Microsoft, Dr. James Whittaker.  After explaining the history and progression of computer technology over the last 40 years and how it evolves about every 10 years he stated, "Now is the time to get into tech."  His statement resonated with me, further confirming that I am on the right track in my pursuit to enter this field...now.  I have come full circle and been given a second chance to pursue a passion that was sparked in 6th grade.

### 2.  If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?  

If I am accepted into ADA, I see myself using my developer skills to launch a small start-up that combine my passions for education, engineering, and community outreach.

### 3.  After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community? (http://adadevelopersacademy.org/program)

As a teacher, fostering a culture of diversity and inclusivity is something I practice in my classroom everyday.  All of my students work at different paces to achieve various levels of mastery.  In order for my classroom to be a safe place for my students to take risks, make mistakes, and learn, we all have to participate to create that culture -- together.  BUT, just because I put a group of students together and tell them to "Go forth and create.", doesn't mean it happens without conflict.  I have to teach them skills that will help them reach resolution.  It is all a learning process and one that requires risk on everyone's part.  Risk to be honest and vulnerable enough to make mistakes.  Risk to trust each other to share ideas, especially those that are out of the box.  Risk to keep trying and not give up, especially when things are difficult.  I learn from them; they learn from me; they learn from each other; we learn together.  And much like the way I expect my students to participate in creating a safe, positive learning environment, I will contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community first by accepting WHO people are and WHERE they are while being WHO I AM.  I will also contribute by having a positive attitude when programming becomes frustrating or circumstnces less than ideal.  Another contribution I will make is to take the risks necessary to learn web development, even after I complete the Ada Development Academy program.

### 4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?

Recently I had the priveledge to learn how to kayak, something I had never done before.  I had a blast, but I was not very good at it.  I fell out 7 times before I got the hang of it.  

Try #1-#3: The lifegaurds helped me get situated, and as soon as they let the kayak go, I flipped over; I was not balanced.  Laughing hystercally, I stood up and tried again and a third.  Same problem -- I flipped over.  One of the lifegaurds saw the problem was with my seat, so she got me a different kayak. Then I tried again.  By this time, one of my friends decided this was something worth capturing on video.  First problem fixed.  

Try #4: I am in the kayak, stable and balanced.  This time, now I have to learn to manuever with the paddle.  After 3 strokes, I am in the water again.  But that is okay, because I made progress.  I walk back to shore, and get back in. 

Try #5: Stable, balanced, and now I am holding the paddles the correct way.  This time, I got it - so I thought.  I made it farther out and deeper than before.  By this time, not only are my friends cheering me on, but strangers are as well.  Then I am joined by my friend in her kayak, and she bumps me and over I flip.  Oh so close this time. 

Try #6: I walk all the way back to the shore, because I am not strong enough to pull myself into the kayak correcty.  I get back in. Stable, balanced, paddles held correctly, and out I go, this time warning everyone in my pathway to get out of the way. Success! I got the hang of it!!!  Everyone steers clear though, and I am very careful not to lose my balance or go too fast.  My friend challenges me to go under the pier and circle back around.  I decline because by this time I am exhausted.  All of those tries took more out of me than I realized.  In all the excitement and perseverance, I didn't realize how tired I had become.  The time for our rental was coming to an end, and we made our way back to the shore.  But there was someone just getting started, and I tried to back up.  THAT apparenty was a brand new skill I needed to master because I flipped over one last time!

The next time I go kayaking, I will ask for a kayak with a "special" seat.  I will then make sure I am stable, balanced, holding the paddle correctly, and try to steer clear of others in my pathway.  But I certainly hope one thing will not change -- my ability to have a blast while taking a risk to learn something new and exciting.
